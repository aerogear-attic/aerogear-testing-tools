= Aerogear Testing Tooling image:https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-testing-tools.svg["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-testing-tools"]

This repository contains various tools used to test Aerogear project.

== Arquillian OpenShift Non Deploying Container

This is an Arquillian container that does not deploy anything but uses container configuration to return deployment URL.
You can use this container to easily switch between functional tests that test local deployment and functional tests that
test same deployment already available on OpenShift cartridge

== Arquillian Rule

This is an Arquillian extension that bring enhanced support of JUnit MethodRule to Arquillian. 
Following

* Rule attributes are injected by Arquillian
* Rule is executed as around invoke of Test execution. This means after last Before and before first After. This allows Rule to access 
  the some context as test itself
* Rule is injected by @ArquillianRule, being completely ignored from JUnit point of view

Rule is always method based. However, if made static and with internal flag, it can be force to run once per class as well.

== Arquillian Smart URL

This is an Arquillian extension that allows to change injected URL via @ArquillianResource to a different protocol. This comes handy
if you want for instance test against _https_, as Arquillian always return _http_.

== Unified Push Server Cartridge CLI

This is a command line tool that allows to create and control UPS. Is is able to:

* create an OpenShift cartridge, based on github organization, repository, commit (branch)
* add sample data to UPS (Push Application, Variants, Installations)
* delete all data on UPS
* dump selected data, so they can be used for instance to configure mobile application
* batch creation of push applications, variants and installations (in thousands) by one command via custom UPS endpoints

== Spacelift JBoss instance manager

By this artifact, you can start and stop JBoss instances programmatically via Spacelift tooling and use jboss-cli scripts via Spacelift as well.
Please See README in that project itself.
